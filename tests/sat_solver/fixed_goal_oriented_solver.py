Simplified Goal-Oriented 3-SAT Solver

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This is a highly simplified script for basic testing and does NOT implement a complete 3-SAT solving
algorithm. It only checks if an all-True assignment satisfies the formula. This solver is intended
for educational purposes and basic testing only, not for solving general 3-SAT problems.
