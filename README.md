## Introduction

SAT (Satisfiability) problems play a crucial role in computer science, particularly in areas such as logic programming, heuristics, and the P vs NP question. The **Satsify** framework is built to facilitate research in these areas by providing a robust set of tools for working with CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form) files. 

Whether you are benchmarking different SAT solvers or transforming CNF files for various experiments, Satsify offers a user-friendly interface and efficient algorithms to support your research.

## Features

- **Parsing CNF Files**: Easily read and manipulate CNF files with built-in parsers.
- **Transformations**: Apply various transformations to CNF files to prepare them for different SAT solvers.
- **Benchmarking**: Measure the performance of SAT solvers with customizable benchmarking tools.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help you get started quickly.
- **Community Support**: Join our community to discuss ideas, report issues, and contribute to the project.

## Installation

To install Satsify, clone the repository and install the required packages. Use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Veliz95/Satsify.git
cd Satsify
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Veliz95/Satsify/releases). Make sure to download the appropriate file and execute it as per the instructions provided.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using Satsify in your projects. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```python
from satsify import CNFParser, Benchmark

# Parse a CNF file
cnf = CNFParser.parse('example.cnf')

# Transform the CNF
transformed_cnf = cnf.transform()

# Benchmark a SAT solver
benchmark = Benchmark(solver='example_solver')
results = benchmark.run(transformed_cnf)

print(results)
```

This example demonstrates how to parse a CNF file, transform it, and benchmark a SAT solver. For more detailed examples, refer to the documentation.
